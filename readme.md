# A python Discord Bot
Just a bot I made to do funny things on my discord server.

## Important:
The player uses the `youtube_dl` python library to get the information required to get audio from the URL. Since this uses an external library, you must install it yourself. You can do so by calling `pip install youtube_dl`.

You must have the `ffmpeg` or `avconv` executable in your path environment variable in order for this to work.
